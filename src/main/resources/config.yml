# Configuration for RandomTeleport

# Maximum coordinate (integer). RandomTeleport ensures that its randomly
# select x and z coordinates don't exceed this value.
max: 10000

# Minimum coordinate (integer). RandomTeleport ensures that its randomly
# select x and z coordinates aren't less than this value.
min: -10000

# Maximum number of times to try to teleport someone before giving up.
# RandomTeleport will try "maxAttempts" random locations, one after another,
# stopping at the first suitable loc. ("Suitable" means "a non-lava,
# non-water, non-air" block.) If it fails to find a suitable loc after
# "maxAttempts" tries, RandomTeleport will give up and not teleport the user.
maxAttempts: 30

# Cool-down period: The minimum time between teleports, expressed in seconds.
# Each user has a separate cool-down period.
#
# This string is a duration. Valid values are of the form
# "<integer> <time-unit>". For example:
#
#   "1 second"
#   "3 seconds"
#   "1 hour" (!)
#   "600 milliseconds"
timeBetweenTeleports: "2 minutes"

# How long to wait before teleporting a player (assuming the player doesn't
# have the "noDelay" permission). This string is a duration. Valid values are
# of the form "<integer> <time-unit>". For example:
#
#   "1 second"
#   "3 seconds"
#   "1 hour" (!)
#   "600 milliseconds"
teleportDelay: "3 seconds"
